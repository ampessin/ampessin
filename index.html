        <!-- Personal introduction -->
        As you may have already figured out, my name is Aden Pessin.
        I am currently a student at the <a href= "https://www.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, in the class of 2026. 
        I am pursuing a bachelor of science degree in <strong><a href ="https://www.cics.umass.edu/academics/bs-informatics">Informatics</a></strong>, with a concentration in <strong>Data Science</strong>.
        I am also working towards a certificate in <strong>Public Interest Technology</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <!-- Background and interests -->
        I have always been fascinated by computers, ever since I had my very own laptop at the age of 9. 
        I loved figuring out how all the applications worked, and understanding the processes that allow maximum utilization of the machine. 
        I would teach my family how to personalize their user experience, and how to ensure longevity of their devices by properly caring for them. 
        When I wasn’t talking about computers, I was learning with one. I discovered early on I had a strong curiosity towards how the internet works. 
        Webpages, search engines, databases, security, and viruses. I knew my future career would fall under one, or more, of these topics. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <!-- Education and experience -->
        At UMass Amherst, I have learned so much. From machine learning algorithms in Python, to data structures in Java, webpage design in HTML & CSS, to basic JavaScript, I’ve made very good use of my education. 
        I live by this statement <strong>“Learning Never Stops”</strong>. Considering this, I decided to get myself an internship. 
        While I wasn’t too sure of what or where I wanted to go, I knew that I needed to try something. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <!-- Internship experience -->
        Last summer, I got an internship at <a href="https://www.dcu.org/"> <strong>DCU</strong></a>(Digital Federal Credit Union). 
        There, I was a Data Analyst. I worked in a hybrid environment with the most caring and reliable teammates, who were always open to teaching me new things. 
        Our primary goal was to move incredibly large quantities of data from an older, almost out of date server, to a brand new one. 
        There were lots of issues involved with this, such as duplication management, and keeping critical automated processes staying up to date. We used a variety of tools, such as SQL, PowerBI, MS teams, and much more. 
        I learned all about relational databases, data security, and all types of time management techniques for maximum productivity. 
        I am still working at DCU, and I highly recommend it. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <!-- Hobbies and interests -->
        I also enjoy a large variety of non-tech related interests and hobbies! I am a classic New Englander; I love to hike, ski, rock climb, and generally be outdoors. 
        I have been skiing since I was very little, and every year since 6th grade, my Dad and I have gone out west. 
        I’ve been to Jackson Hole, Vail, Beaver Creek, Big Sky, Snowbird, and Alta, just to name a few. 
        I also climbed the face of Cathedral Ledge, New Hampshire, in 2022. Here is a photo of me and my Dad at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in April of 2016!
