I then checked the length of the input string, if it has one character, and is an english letter, that means it is almost a valid input. The next if statement is on a different line, so that the user can understand why the input did not compute. In this case, it is to check if the guess has already been guessed.

It ended up working in my favor, as I realized since I made them index'd, I can use the strike counter to call them. Fortunately, I took full advantage of using pseudocode, so I always had some sort of direction.\n",
